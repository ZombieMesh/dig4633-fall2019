Using Image tracking (which we did not get to in class so this is just space position tracking), trading card games could bridge the gap between their physical games and their digital counterparts. An app that can be used to view 3D models of the art on the cards, or super imposes their stats and has those stats be interactable could be wildly popular. The app could also be used to teach new players about how to position their cards (as many Trading Card Games have boards that need to be followed) superimposing a board layout template onto a table or showing beacons on where to put certain cards.
